# Hello, World! I'm Hugo ðŸ‘‹

<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Developer** with a passion for bringing ideas to life in the browser. Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, and that passion has driven me to design and develop websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. 

I am currently seeking my first Junior Developer role.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Project

- **[AgeLapse](https://github.com/hugocornellier/AgeLapse)** ðŸ“¸: **AgeLapse** is an app that allows users to create stabilized time-lapse videos of their faces over time. It auto-aligns images based on facial landmarks, making it easy for anyone to document their aging process or any other long-term transformation.

## ðŸ“ƒ I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. Itâ€™s like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?
