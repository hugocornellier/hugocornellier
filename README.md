# Hello, World! I'm Hugo ðŸ‘‹

<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Developer** with a passion for bringing ideas to life. Growing up in the '90s and early 2000s, I fell in love with the internet, and that passion has driven me to design and develop applications and websites that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone.
